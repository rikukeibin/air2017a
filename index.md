Papers must be unpublished and must not be submitted for publication elsewhere. All papers will be reviewed by Program Committee members and other experts active in the field to ensure high quality and relevance to the conference. Submissions should include author information, abstract, 5-10 keywords, and be in PDF format. Each submission must not exceed 8 pages in the Springer publications format with 10 point font, including tables, figures and references. Template formatting is located at [https://www.springer.com/gp/authors-editors/book-authors-editors/manuscript-preparation/5636](https://www.springer.com/gp/authors-editors/book-authors-editors/manuscript-preparation/5636). The final version will be limited to **8 pages** in Springer LNCS format for conference papers. Up to 2 extra pages may be purchased.

Each submission should be regarded as an undertaking that, should the submission be accepted, at least one of the authors must register the paper and attend the conference to present the work in order for the accepted paper to be submitted into the EI Compendex.
